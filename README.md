# Predictive Modeling for CPU Usage and Contraceptive Method Choice

This repository explores predictive modeling techniques for two different use cases:
1. CPU Usage Prediction: Analyzing and forecasting CPU usage to optimize system performance and resource allocation.
2. Contraceptive Method Choice Prediction: Identifying factors influencing contraceptive method choices using classification models.

## Project Overview
This project applies predictive modeling to two distinct domains:
- **CPU Usage Prediction:** Time series analysis to predict CPU usage trends and improve resource management.
- **Contraceptive Method Choice Prediction:** Classification modeling to analyze demographic and socio-economic factors influencing contraceptive choices.

## Objectives
- For CPU Usage Prediction:
  - Analyze historical CPU usage data to identify patterns and trends.
  - Develop predictive models to forecast CPU usage for effective resource allocation.
- For Contraceptive Method Choice Prediction:
  - Identify key factors influencing contraceptive method choices.
  - Build classification models to predict contraceptive method preferences.

## Approach
1. **Data Analysis:** 
   - CPU Usage: Time series analysis to explore usage patterns and trends.
   - Contraceptive Method Choice: Exploratory data analysis to understand demographic and socio-economic factors.
2. **Predictive Modeling:** 
   - CPU Usage: Time series forecasting models (ARIMA, LSTM).
   - Contraceptive Method Choice: Classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest).
3. **Business Reporting:** Strategic insights and recommendations based on predictive modeling results.
